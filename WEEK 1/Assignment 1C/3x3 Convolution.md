# 3x3 Convolution

The **3x3 Convolution Filter/ 3x3 Kernel Matrix** is used to change the *Depth results* of the Input Image feature Matrix. Based on the studies the Kernel is used to allocate ***Max pooling values*** or to calculate the maximum values by elementary multiplication of the Input Image matrix to the Kernel Matrix. The following Output Matrix obtained is further passed on in the Neural Net to achieve the Accurate Results.

For Example, The input Image consists of the Features as follows:

The Kernel Values are Multiplied Elementally and the Maximum values are fetched and passed further to the Convolution Neural Net System as shown below:
