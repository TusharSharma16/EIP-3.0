# 1x1 Convolution

The input image is initially converted to feature matrix with parameters:

**N** as the batch size (Defined with Epoch)

**F** is the number of Kernels

**H** and **W** are dimension parameters of the image (Defined in the Matrix Representations)

The 1x1 Convolution is used to change the Dimensions of the Matrix to obtain a particular amount of Data. It is usually used to change the Depth Parameter of the Input Image to Obtain a Output Image and Passed to Further Filters for Accurate Results.

For Example: The Below Image contains the RGB format with 3 Layers of 6x6 Matrices. The depth of the image is 3 because of **R**ed **G**reen **B**lue format pixels. After the Image is Convolved with a Filter of 1x1 Kernel, Then the Depth is Changed to 1.
