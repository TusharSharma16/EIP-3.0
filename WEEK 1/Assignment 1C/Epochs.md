# Epochs

Epoch is often considered as the number of iterations, but Epoch is associated with the **traversal of Complete Dataset in Forward as well as Backward Propagation in the Neural Net**. It is considered as the **HyperParameter** which is dependent on the Dataset which can be either

1. Overfitted

2. UnderFitted

3. Optimum

   Based on the configuration of the Batch Size and Epochs:![16](/home/tushar/Downloads/EIP-3.0/WEEK 1/images/16.png)

   Epoch also determines the Loss and Accuracy of the Results.

   As the Training Examples are passed in the Neural Net, the Accuracy of the Neural Nets improve and the Loss Function values are decreased as shown in figure below:

   As mentioned above if the Epoch and Batch Size is optimum, the Above Target is Achieved. if not the Configurations are to be tested and Changed Based on the Accuracy mentioned in the Epoch of the Datasets.
